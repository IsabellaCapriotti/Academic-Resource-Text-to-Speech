# Text to Speech GUI
A simple user interface for making requests to read text aloud through Google's Text-to-Speech API. 

After entering the desired text into the entry box, the program can generate an MP3 file with a recording of that text read aloud. 
It includes options to adjust the voice used for the request and the speed of the voice.
